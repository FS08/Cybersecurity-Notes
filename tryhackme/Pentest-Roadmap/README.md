# TryHackMe – Pentest Roadmap Notes & Organization Guide

This repository documents my progress through the **TryHackMe Pentest Roadmap**.

The goal of this structure is to:

* ✅ Keep notes **clean, reusable, and future-proof**
* ✅ Separate theory, labs, and tools
* ✅ Avoid leaking flags or sensitive data
* ✅ Build a **professional public knowledge base** usable beyond TryHackMe

## 📌 High-Level Repository Structure

```text
TryHackMe/
└── Pentest-Roadmap/
    ├── 00-PreSecurity/
    ├── 01-CyberSecurity101/
    ├── 02-...
```

Each module follows the **same internal structure** so navigation stays consistent.

---

## 📂 Module Structure (Template)

Each module (example: `00-PreSecurity`) is organized like this:

```text
00-PreSecurity/
├── README.md
├── Certificate/
│   └── PreSecurity.png
├── Labs/
│   ├── IntroToLinux/
│   │   └── notes.md
│   └── NetworkFundamentals/
│       └── notes.md
├── Notes/
│   ├── Networking.md
│   ├── Linux-Basics.md
│   └── Web-Concepts.md
|
└── Tools/
    └── nmap.md
```

### Purpose of each folder

| Folder         | Purpose                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `README.md`    | Overview & summary of the module   |
| `Certificate/` | Completion proof only              |
| `Labs/`        | Hands-on room notes (no raw flags) |
| `Notes/`       | Theory & concepts                  |
| `Tools/`       | Tool-specific cheat sheets         |

## 🧠 How to Take Efficient Cybersecurity Notes

### Golden Rule

> Write notes as if **future you forgot everything**.

Focus on:

* ✅ Concepts, not steps
* ✅ Attacker mindset
* ✅ Reusable patterns
* ❌ No copy-paste from platforms
