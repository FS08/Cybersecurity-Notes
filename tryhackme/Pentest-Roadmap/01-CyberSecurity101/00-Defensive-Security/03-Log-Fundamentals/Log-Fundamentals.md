# Log Fundamentals

## What this is
Logs are the digital footprints left behind by any activity. The activity could be a normal one or the one with malicious intent. Tracing down the activity and the individual behind the execution of that activity becomes easier through logs.

There are various places inside a system where the traces of an attack could be fetched. The logs contain most of these traces. 

### Use Cases of Logs

- `Incident Investigation and Forensics` : Logs are the traces of every kind of activity. It offers detailed information on what happened during the incident. The security team utilizes the logs to perform root cause analysis of incidents.
