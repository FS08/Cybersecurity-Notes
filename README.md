# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Notes & Labs

Welcome to my cybersecurity notes !  
This repo is a structured, hands-on knowledge base I use to document what I learn while preparing for a cybersecurity internship and solving CTFs.

It includes notes from:
- TryHackMe labs
- HackTheBox boxes
- Scripting and automation
- Blue Team tools (SIEM, detection, forensics)
- Red Team methods (pentesting, privilege escalation)
- Cheat sheets and personal writeups

## 🔄 How I Update Progress

I update this table weekly as I complete TryHackMe rooms, CTFs, write reports, or build scripts.  
Each task I finish is also documented in its relevant folder with:
- Screenshots or payloads
- Lessons learned
- Exploits or logs used
